#### Basic example

Here's a minimal C program:

**min.c**  [link](../code/min.c)

```
int main()
{
  int i = 258;
  float f = 3.141592653589793;
  return 0;
}
```

We can compile it with debugging information, from the top-level directory of this project, ``debug``:

```
> cd debug
> clang code/min.c -g -o exe/min
```

The debugging symbols file (``min.dSYM``) automatically goes to the same directory as ``min``.

Now launch lldb with the path to ``min``

```
lldb exe/min
```

which reveals a problem that is caused by lldb looking for python, and finding my Homebrew version.

```
(lldb) target create "exe/min"
Traceback ...
ImportError: cannot import name _remove_dead_weakref
Current executable set to 'exe/min' (x86_64).
(lldb)
```

Apparently, the problem is that at least sometimes, ``lldb`` finds the Homebrew Python.

One way we can solve this is by modifying the launch command:

```
> export PATH=/usr/bin; lldb exe/min
(lldb) target create "min"
Current executable set to 'min' (x86_64).
(lldb)
```

or by changing the ``$PATH`` as a standalone command.

#### Basic commands for lldb

- ``r`` for ``run``
- ``b`` for `` set breakpoint``
- ``n`` for ``next``

```
(lldb) r exe/min
Process 3442 launched: '/Users/telliott_admin/Desktop/debug/exe/min' (x86_64)
Process 3442 exited with status = 0 (0x00000000) 
```

Not too interesting!  The last line of output is ``lldb``, which I will suppress.

Set a breakpoint on ``main``:

```
(lldb) b main
Breakpoint 1: where = min`main + 21 at min.c:3, address = 0x0000000100000fa5
(lldb) r
Process 3448 launched: '/Users/telliott_admin/Desktop/debug/exe/min' (x86_64)
Process 3448 stopped
* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = breakpoint 1.1
    frame #0: 0x0000000100000fa5 min`main at min.c:3
   1   	int main()
   2   	{
-> 3   	  int i = 258;
   4   	  float f = 3.141592653589793;
   5   	  return 0;
   6   	}
Target 0: (min) stopped.
```

This line

```
-> 3   	  int i = 258;
```

shows the instruction that is about to be executed.  The unitialized variable has random or at least irrelevant content:

```
(lldb) p i
(int) $0 = 12342
```

So step to the next line with ``n`` and then:

```
(lldb) p i
(int) $1 = 258
```

We obtain the value of the variable.  We can find its address with ``&``:

```
(lldb) print &i
(int *) $2 = 0x00007ffeefbffa08
(lldb) print &f
(float *) $3 = 0x00007ffeefbffa04
```

``i`` and ``f`` are contiguous in memory, 4 bytes apart, with the later defined variable at the lower address.  This should be on the stack, we will see whether that's true later on.

An important command (with lots of options) is 

- ``x`` for ``examine`` memory at an address

```
(lldb) x/4b &i
0x7ffeefbffa08: 0x02 0x01 0x00 0x00
```

The formatting ``/4b`` asks for 4 bytes (``i`` is a C ``int``).

```
(lldb) print sizeof(i)
(unsigned long) $5 = 4
```

The bytes are little-endian, least significant first.

The default output is hex.  Step again with ``n`` so that ``f`` is declared and assigned:

```
float f = 3.141592653589793;
```

The size of a float in C is:

```
(lldb) print sizeof(f)
(unsigned long) $7 = 4
(lldb)
```

> on most systems this is the IEEE 754 single-precision binary floating-point format (32 bits)

The ``unsigned long`` actually refers to the value ``4``.  To get a 64-bit floating point number, we should declare ``f`` as a ``double``.

Examine the value of ``f``

```
(lldb) x/4b &f
0x7ffeefbffa04: 0xdb 0x0f 0x49 0x40
```

This is the correct value for a float representation of ``3.141592653589793`` (see the floating point write-up).

The value in memory actually corresponds to ``3.1415927410125732..`` which is basically this fraction

```
o = (pi - 2)/(4-2) = pi/2 - 1
  = 0.5707963267948966
```

of the distance between ``2`` and ``4``, times ``2e23``

```
M = 2^23 * o
  = 4788186.633322284
```

truncated and rounded up to ``4788187`` because ``0.57 > 0.5``.
