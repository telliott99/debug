We can define new commands differently than what we've done [here](3.md). [link](http://www.fabianguerra.com/ios/introduction-to-lldb-python-scripting/).

[**cmds2.py**](../code/cmds2.py)

```
...

def __lldb_init_module(debugger, internal_dict): 
    cmd = 'command script add -f print_command.print_frame print_frame' 
    debugger.HandleCommand(cmd)
    s = 'The "print_frame" python command has been installed and is ready for use.'
    print s

```

So we have the function ``__lldb_init_module`` defined in ``code/cmds2.py``.  

The ``command script add`` part will get done for us automatically.  Then all we have to do is ``comand script import`` from lldb.  

The new command will be called ``print_frame``

```
def print_frame(debugger, command, result, internal_dict):
    target = debugger.GetSelectedTarget()
    process = target.GetProcess()
    thread = process.GetSelectedThread()

    for frame in thread:
        print >>result, str(frame)

```

I haven't used the ``>>`` before.  From the Python docs:

> This form is sometimes referred to as “print chevron.” In this form, the first expression after the >> must evaluate to a “file-like” object, specifically an object that has a write() method as described above. With this extended form, the subsequent expressions are printed to this file object.
> 

Recall that ``result`` is an argument to the command we're defining, so I guess it is a file-like object and this is just the way we are returning results to ``lldb``.

To use ``print_frame`` with [**min.c**](../code/min.c)

```
> lldb exe/min
(lldb) target create "exe/min"
Current executable set to 'exe/min' (x86_64).
(lldb) command script import code/cmds2.py
The "print_frame" python command has been installed and is ready for use.
(lldb) b main
Breakpoint 1: where = min`main + 21 at min.c:3, address = 0x0000000100000fa5
(lldb) r
Process 4116 launched: '/Users/telliott_admin/Desktop/debug/exe/min' (x86_64)
Process 4116 stopped
* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = breakpoint 1.1
    frame #0: 0x0000000100000fa5 min`main at min.c:3
   1   	int main()
   2   	{
-> 3   	  int i = 258;
   4   	  float f = 3.141592653589793;
   5   	  return 0;
   6   	}
Target 0: (min) stopped.
```
Now

```
(lldb) print_frame
frame #0: 0x0000000100000fa5 min`main at min.c:3
frame #1: 0x00007fff60e3ced9 libdyld.dylib`start + 1
frame #2: 0x00007fff60e3ced9 libdyld.dylib`start + 1
(lldb) 
```

To do this every time you hit a particular breakpoint:

```
(lldb) br command add 2
Enter your debugger command(s).  Type 'DONE' to end.
> print_frame 
> DONE
```

The two is breakpoint 2:

```

```

The ``DONE`` will disappear and you go back out to ``(lldb)``.

Just look at our breakpoints 

```
(lldb) br list
Current breakpoints:
1: name = 'main', locations = 1
  1.1: where = min`main + 21 at min.c:3, address = min[0x0000000100000fa5], unresolved, hit count = 0 

2: file = '/Users/telliott_admin/Desktop/debug/code/min.c', line = 4, exact_match = 0, locations = 1
    Breakpoint commands:
      print_frame

  2.1: where = min`main + 28 at min.c:4, address = min[0x0000000100000fac], unresolved, hit count = 0 

(lldb)
```
