#### call Python code from lldb

#### basic example

[link](http://ryanipete.com/blog/lldb/python/how_to_create_a_custom_lldb_command_pt_1/)

[**cmds1.py**](../code/cmds1.py)

```
def print_world(debugger, command, result, internal_dict):
    print "world!"
```

We need to tell lldb where to find this very useful tool.  Launch lldb from the ``debug`` folder, then from within lldb do:

```
command script import code/cmds1.py
command script add -f cmds1.print_world hello
```
So let's do it

```
> lldb exe/min
(lldb) target create "min"
Current executable set to 'min' (x86_64).
(lldb) command script import cmds1.py
(lldb) command script add -f cmds1.print_world hello
(lldb) hello
world!
(lldb)
```

#### Automatically load command file

It would be nice to automate the ``command script import..`` part.


Init files called ``.lldbinit`` are executed when you start an lldb session.  If the file is placed in the user's home directory, it will be loaded for every session.

If it is in the project directory it will only be loaded for that specific project.

[**lldbinit**](../code/lldbinit1.txt)

```
command script import cmds1.py
command script add -f cmds1.print_world hello
```

So copy that file to the project directory ``debug``:

```
cp code/lldbinit1 .lldbinit
```

Now launch ``lldb`` again:

```
> lldb exe/min
There is a .lldbinit file in the current directory which is not being read.
To silence this warning without sourcing in the local .lldbinit,
add the following to the lldbinit file in your home directory:
    settings set target.load-cwd-lldbinit false
To allow lldb to source .lldbinit files in the current working directory,
set the value of this variable to true.  Only do so if you understand and
accept the security risk.
(lldb) target create "min"
Current executable set to 'min' (x86_64).
```

The warning speaks for itself.  Do I understand the security risk?  No.

What we need to do is to make another ``.lldbinit`` in our home directory with

[**lldbinit**](../code/lldbinit2.txt)

```
settings set target.load-cwd-lldbinit true
```

Try it.

```
cp code/lldbinit2.txt ~/.lldbinit
```

```
> lldb exe/min
(lldb) target create "exe/min"
Current executable set to 'exe/min' (x86_64).
(lldb) command source -s 1 '/Users/telliott_admin/Desktop/debug/.lldbinit'
(lldb) hello
world!
(lldb)
```

And it works!

```
rm ~/.lldbinit
rm ~/Desktop/debug/.lldbinit
```
